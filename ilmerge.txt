notes:

I couldn't use the NuGet package for Migrator Dot Net because it didn't have the MSBuild project. The MSBuild assembly from the web references a different version than the nuget package.

the /targetplatform switch is very important. You'll get missing references to system.core and for anything targeting .net 4 (like lambdas) wouldn't compile correctly and would result in runtime errors (missing method exceptions)
