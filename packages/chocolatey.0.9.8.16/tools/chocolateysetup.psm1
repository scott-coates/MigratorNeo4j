	.DESCRIPTION
		This will initialize the Chocolatey tool by
			a) setting up the "nugetPath" (the location where all chocolatey nuget packages will be installed)
			b) Installs chocolatey into the "nugetPath"
			c) Adds chocolaty to the PATH environment variable so you have access to the chocolatey|cinst commands.
	.PARAMETER  NuGetPath
		Allows you to override the default path of (C:\Chocolatey\) by specifying a directory chocolaty will install nuget packages.

	.EXAMPLE
		C:\PS> Initialize-Chocolatey

		Installs chocolatey into the default C:\Chocolatey\ directory.

	.EXAMPLE
		C:\PS> Initialize-Chocolatey -nugetPath "D:\ChocolateyInstalledNuGets\"

		Installs chocolatey into the custom directory D:\ChocolateyInstalledNuGets\

We are setting up the Chocolatey repository for NuGet packages that should be at the machine level. Think executables/application packages, not library packages.
That is what Chocolatey NuGet goodness is for.
The repository is set up at `'$chocolateyPath`'.
The packages themselves go to `'$chocolateyLibPath`' (i.e. $nugetYourPkgPath).
A batch file for the command line goes to `'$chocolateyExePath`' and points to an executable in `'$nugetYourPkgPath`'.

Chocolatey is now ready.
You can call chocolatey from anywhere, command line or powershell by typing chocolatey.
Run chocolatey /? for a list of functions.
You may need to shut down and restart powershell and/or consoles first prior to using chocolatey.
If you are upgrading chocolatey from an older version (prior to 0.9.8.15) and don't use a custom chocolatey path, please find and delete the C:\NuGet folder after verifying that C:\Chocolatey has the same contents (minus chocolateyinstall of course).
