## About MigratorNeo4j

ILMerged some custom Neo4j migration code with Migrator Dot Net. I know it's kind of a weird thing, but we're using this as a way to do sql migrations and neo4j migrations (think adding an index, modifying data) all in one go.

Built on the following projects:

* [Neo4jClient] (http://code.google.com/p/migratordotnet/)
* [MigratorDotNet] (http://hg.readify.net/neo4jclient/wiki/Home)
